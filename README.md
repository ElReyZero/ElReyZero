### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm ElReyZero ![alt text](https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/457124/1)

I'm studying Systems Engineering and Software Development, I know Python, Java and a bit of C. I like to contribute to translations and bug fixing for mods and projects of games that I like.
I'm Colombian, so if you don't understand some of my repos, it might be because most of my programs have been written in Spanish. Also most of them are old works and proyects written for my Uni.

### I've Contributed to:
#### POG Bot Turned into the BWAE Battle Bot
This has been my biggest project/contribution as of yet.

I turned the Planetside Open Games [POG Bot](https://github.com/yakMM/POG-bot) into the [BWAE Battle Bot](https://github.com/ElReyZero/BWAEBattleBot)

In addition to the original bot, I've added:
- 1v1 matches
- TDM matches, wanna do a 6v6? Go for it. 2v2? 3v2? Or even 100v100? You can do it! (you can adjust the lobby size using =lbsize)
- Custom round time. Use =rndtime to change the next match's duration
- A training mode where you can set a custom amount of rounds
- And more...
